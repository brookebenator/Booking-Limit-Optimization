# Booking-Limit-Optimization

In my MAR4524 - Consumer Demand with Big Data course, I learned how to optimize booking limits that can be applied to real-world industries. In this example, the Newsvendor model is being applied to create an optimal protection level for an airline booking. The optimal protection level will be how many seats are saved for high fare customers (business travelers), along with the optimal booking limit for low fare customers (leisure travelers). I used advanced Excel techniques and tools such as Data Tables under What-If Analysis and Solver.
